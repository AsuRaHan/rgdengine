		<Line>Two hearts fading, like a flower.</Line>
		<Line>And all this waiting, for the power.</Line>
		<Line>For some answer, to this fire.</Line>
		<Line>Sinking slowly. The wateras higher.</Line>
		<Line>Desire</Line>
		<Line>Desire</Line>
		<Line></Line>
		<Line>With no secrets. No obsession.</Line>
		<Line>This time I'm speeding with no direction.</Line>
		<Line>Without a reason. What is this fire?</Line>
		<Line>Burning slowly. My one and only.</Line>
		<Line>Desire</Line>
		<Line>Desire</Line>
		<Line>Desire</Line>
		<Line>Desire</Line>
		<Line></Line>
		<Line>You know me. You don't mind waiting.</Line>
		<Line>You just can't show me, but God I'm praying,</Line>
		<Line>That you'll find me, and that you'll see me,</Line>
		<Line>That you run and never tire.</Line>
